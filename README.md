# Lotteries Results

This project was created to my studies, it's a frontend application that shows the results from lotteries. 

In this first part, I created the application using reactJs, and [redux/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) to control the states of my application.


**Atention:** this giveaway is illustrative of an api test.
